\title{Internal function to integrate clonality data into final garnish_score.}
\usage{
clone_wars(dt)
}
\value{
A data table with added fitness model parameter columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{clone_id}: The rank of the clone containing the variant in that sample, with the first being the largest fraction of the tumor.
\item \strong{clone_prop}: The estimated clustered mean value for the proportion of the tumor composed of that clone.
\item \strong{garnish_score}: the summary parameter of immunogenicity at the sample level, summed across dominant neoepitopes of each clone.
}
}
\description{
Integrates clonality input to create a summary metric of tumor fitness similar to \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29132144}{Luksza et al. Nature 2017}.
